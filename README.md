Figure: Dual-camera refractive deflectometry for lens metrology. (a) Hardware setup. (b) Captured phase-shifted images, from which on-screen intersections are obtained. (c) A ray tracer models the setup by ray tracing each parameterized refractive surface, obtaining the modeled intersections. (d) Unknown parameters and pose are jointly optimized by minimizing the error between measurement and modeled.
